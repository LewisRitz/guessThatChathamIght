			<h1 class="pageHeader">About Us</h1>

			<h5>Through group bike rides, Bike4Beds raises funds and gives 100% of the donations to empower partnered organizations of underprivileged communities.</h5>

			<h2 class="mainSubHeading">Our Goal</h2>
			<h5>Each year we donate the money we raise to that years cause. The past 6 years we have raised over $20,000 for our beneficiaries.</h5>

			<h2 class="mainSubHeading">Our Charity</h2>
			<h5>This year we are riding to support the academic and health services of the Cavaillon Orphange and the All of God’s Children Orphanage in Haiti.</h5>

			<h5>100% of the funds raised by this Bike4Beds event will assist the Cavailon Orphange provide tuition, school supplies, school uniforms, food, and medical items for their orphans as well as fund an exciting IT education program at the All of God’s Children Orphanage elementary school.</h5>

			<h2 class="mainSubHeading">The Bike Ride</h2>
			<h5>This upcoming event includes a variety of scenic routes, ranging from 25 miles to a full century ride from eastern NJ down to Wildwood.</h5>

			<h5>This is a fun bike ride all the way from the countryside to the boardwalk; many of our friends and family return every year.</h5>

			<h5>Join us for an early spring tour of what the garden state has to offer cyclists of all ages and abilities.</h5>

			<h2 class="mainSubHeading">Your Suppport</h2>
			<h5>Bike4Beds is able to make a positive impact thanks to the generosity of our donors, enthusiasm from our bike riders, and selfless assistance from our volunteers.</h5>

			<h5>We are deeply grateful to everyone who has helped us in the previous years in our efforts to assist the Cavaillon Orphanage, the Dispensaire de Hiheatro in Hiheatro, Togo and the Maluti Hospital in the Kingdom of Lesotho.</h5>

			<h5>Register to bike, sign up to volunteer, sponsor a biker, or simply like us on Facebook and help us continue to support schools and hospitals, and dispensaries in communities across the world.</h5>

			<h5>Bike4Beds is a nonprofit organization that hosts a Fall and Spring bike event every year to raise funds for the current years cause. Our first event was in 2008. Matt Ritz, founder of Bike4Beds, had the idea to organize a bike ride for charity when he learned of the deteriorated conditions of the equipment at the Maluti Hospital, particularly of the patients’ beds. Akoua Enow was in her second year raising AIDS awareness with the Peace Corps. and communicated the need for assistance at the Hospital. Our first bike ride through New Jersey was successful and we purchased 42 beds for the hospital and its patients! The ‘Bike4Beds’ name stuck and membership grew each year as event popularity spread. Bike4Beds was granted Federal Non-Profit status on March 1, 2011. In our 6 years we have donated over $20,000 dollars to our beneficiaries. We continue to update our events with new routes and options, in order to engage more bikers and encourage new membership.</h5>

			<h5>In 2009 we donated supplies to the Dispensaire de Hiheatrowe. We were made aware of the need for assistance from a close family member, Kossiwa Lonergan. Kossiwa had first hand exposure to the dispensaire and its’ current condition while visiting her home country of Togo in 2009. In 2010 we began our four year running sponsorship of the Cavaillon Orphanage, run by the Sisters of Charity of Saint-Hyacinthe. Maguey O’Connor, a good family friend, suggested this beneficiary from her experience growing up in Haiti. The Cavaillon Orphange relies solely on donations to support their 25 students. Donating to this organization for four years in a row allows our bikers, sponsors and volunteers to feel focused in their efforts to make the world a better place, one community at a time.</h5>

			<h5>Bike4Beds recently brought on a team of chief officers, tasked with taking our organization to the next level. We are working towards expanding our options and events, gaining new membership and ultimately expanding our scope of support. Get ready for exciting new changes coming soon!</h5>

			<h1 class="pageHeader">Previous Years</h1>
			<h2 class="mainSubHeading">2008: Maluti Aventist Hospital Lesotho</h2>
			<h3>My niece (Akoua) is a Peace Core Volunteer in Lesotho; her main objective is to combat the HIV/AIDS proliferation. She works for the Maluti Aventist Hospital, which has a serious need for hospital beds.</h3>

			<h3>The hospital beds are foam mattresses with a plastic covering. The plastic is torn or missing on a large majority of the beds allowing bodily fluid to seep into the foam. Akoua's mother and father visited her this past winter and couldn’t believe how disgusting and unhealthy the situation actually is. In a small effort to help the Maluti Hospital, we want to outfit the hospital with new sanitary beds.</h3>

			<h3>We are biking 100 miles in an effort to raise money for the Maluti Aventist Hospital to purchase new beds. If you are interested in donating or biking, please email bikeforbeds@gmail.com. One Hundred Percent of all donations will go to the Maluti Aventist Hospital.</h3>

			<h3>With a shortage of trained personnel and medical supplies, Lesotho is severely afflicted by HIV/AIDS. According to recent estimates, the prevalence is about 29%, one of the highest in the world. The United Nations projects that this will rise to 36% within fifteen years, resulting in a sharp drop in life expectancy. According to the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics, in 2001 life expectancy was estimated at forty-eight years for men and fifty-six for women. Recent statistics estimate about thirty-seven years. Many children have lost parents. Traditionally lavish funerals leave survivors with another burden.”</h3>

			<h2 class="mainSubHeading">2009: Dispensaire de Hiheatro</h2>
			<h3>My last visit to Togo was February 09, and I was very surprised by what I saw. We visited the Dispensaire de Hiheatro (child birthing and first aid dispensary). I could not believe what I saw, it was hard to imagine that some people have so much and others have almost nothing. The dispensaire was very run down but the staff was still able to take care of many people. The baby scale was destroyed, and they didn’t even have a thermometer. I was so ashamed to see that patients shared bed pans. They also needed some beds and clean linens. I talked to Matt when I came home and we quickly concluded that we should do a bike ride fundraiser to help the people at the dispensaire, back in my home country of Togo. Please help us. Anything you can donate will be extremely useful to the people of Togo.</h3>
			<h3>Thank you very much, Kossiwa Akakpo (Lonergan)</h3>

			<h2 class="mainSubHeading">2010: Cavaillon Orphanage</h2>
			<h3>The Cavaillon Orphanage is located in the South of Haiti, where they foster 25 girls from the ages of 4 through 12. The orphanage is owned and operated by the Sisters of Charity of Saint-Hyacinthe.</h3>

			<h3 class="mainSubHeading">A note from Sr Diane Beaudoin:</h3>

			<h3>We opened our orphanage for little girls in December 2008. The first two little girls who arrived, GisËle and Fafan, came from a city about three hours drive from Cavaillon where the orphanage is located. Fafan was three years old and GisËle was four. Leaving their homes and their families to find themselves with strangers was not easy, but once they arrived they seemed to adjust well. A few weeks after their arrival, the sister and the driver who had brought them to the orphanage arrived for a visit. When Fafan and GisËle saw them they both went to hide. When at last they were found and asked why they were hiding, they both said they were afraid that the man and the sister had come to take them back home, and they did not want to leave the orphanage. Here they have food everyday, lots of other little girls to play with, toys to play with and loving adults to care for them. For the first months that they were there every time the sister and the driver came, they would hide until they finally realized that no one was going to take them away from the orphanage.</h3>

			<h3>One of the first places the little girls would take visitors to the orphanage, was to their bedrooms to show them their beds. They would then proceed to tell the visitors that they each had a bed to sleep in. For most of these little girls it was the first time they slept in a bed.</h3>

			<h3>When Fafan came to the orphanage at age three, she was suffering from malnutrition. One of the effects of malnutrition caused her black hair to turn reddish and her hair just would not grow. The other girls would call her a boy because of her very short hair. This made Fafan very unhappy, the more so because all the other girls had braids and bright ribbons in their hair and she did not. It took a while before we figured out what was making her so unhappy. So Mama Maggie would take the inch long hair and twist it as much as she could and attached a bright ribbon to her hair. Fafan was so happy, she refound her good humor and found new confidence in herself and she began to blossom. Today, two years later she is a happy child with a ready smile and loving personality.</h3>

				<h4>Bike4Beds Century 100 (miles 1-100)</h4>
				<h5>This route is ideal for experienced bikers who are interested in the full century ride through the width of New Jersey and down the coast into Wildwood. This is the original route that we mapped out in an effort to take riders over quiet country roads with scenic views. This moderately flat course is a good course to do your first century. Riders should train for this route. There are multiple rest stops with refreshing beverages and snacks. We will stop at Wawa for lunch. If you complete the full 100 miles, we will add your name to our new Century Club on the website!</h5>
